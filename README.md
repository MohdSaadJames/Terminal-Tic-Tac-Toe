# Terminal-Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a terminal based tic tac toe game created by me in python.

I originally created it as side-project but I didn't want to follow any tutorial so the code might not be the most effecient one......

Any contributions are welcomed.
# Installation

`git clone "https://github.com/MohdSaadJames/Terminal-Tic-Tac-Toe"`

Navigate to the folder/directory **Terminal-Tic-Tac-Toe**
